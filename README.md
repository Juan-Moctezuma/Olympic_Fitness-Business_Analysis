# Olympic Fitness Gym - Business Analysis

### Description
This project derives from the ongoing process of fully remodeling the Olympic Fitness, which is a medium-sized old school style gym or fitness center established in 1973. 
Business owners decided to perform full-scale remodeling and renovation of the establishment. The author of this presentation has been volunteering to multiple phases of the 
Olympic Fitness’ continuous project that was launched in January 2023. The next big milestone is to set up a CrossFit section in the establishment's back patio - this is expected to be completed on 2025.
